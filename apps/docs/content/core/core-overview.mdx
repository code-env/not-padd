# Core Package Overview

The `notpadd-core` package is the foundation of Notpadd, providing a powerful content collection system built on top of content-collections core. It enables you to collect, parse, transform, and manage content files with full TypeScript support.

## Features

- **Type Safe Collections**: Define collections with Zod schemas for full type safety
- **Flexible Parsers**: Support for frontmatter, JSON, YAML, and custom parsers
- **Transform Functions**: Transform documents with access to other collections and caching
- **File Watching**: Automatic rebuilds on file changes during development
- **Notpadd Integration**: Fetch and sync content from Notpadd API
- **Event System**: Comprehensive event emission for build lifecycle hooks

## Installation

```bash
npm install notpadd-core
```

## Basic Usage

```typescript
import { defineConfig, defineCollection } from "notpadd-core";
import { z } from "zod";

const config = defineConfig({
  collections: [
    defineCollection({
      name: "posts",
      directory: "content/posts",
      schema: z.object({
        title: z.string(),
        description: z.string(),
        published: z.boolean(),
      }),
    }),
  ],
});
```

## Core Concepts

### Collections

Collections are groups of content files that share a common schema and configuration. Each collection defines:
- A name for type generation
- A directory where content files are located
- A schema for validation
- Optional parser, transform, and filter options

### Schemas

Schemas use Zod to define the structure and validation rules for your content. The schema is used to:
- Validate frontmatter and metadata
- Generate TypeScript types
- Ensure data consistency across documents

### Parsers

Parsers extract data from content files. Supported parsers include:
- `frontmatter`: Extracts YAML frontmatter and content
- `frontmatter-only`: Extracts only frontmatter
- `json`: Parses JSON files
- `yaml`: Parses YAML files
- Custom parsers: Define your own parsing logic

### Transformers

Transform functions allow you to modify documents after parsing. They have access to:
- Other collections in your configuration
- A caching mechanism for expensive operations
- The ability to skip documents conditionally
