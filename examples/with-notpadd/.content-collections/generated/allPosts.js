    "content": "some people had “straight educational paths” in life. I didn’t. And honestly? That made my journey a lot more interesting (imo).\n\nI skipped nursery school entirely, went straight to **Class One** at the government bilingual primary school in Ebubu, South West Cameroon. Maybe I was “too smart, (something i tell myself)” maybe just stubborn either way, I started school with a bang.\n\nLiving with my grandparents made everything more… dramatic. Every day I’d misplace something, from my uniform to shows and usually my arm boards and my grandma, in true legendary fashion, bought a ceiling board, cut it into four, and gave me a quarter to carry. Imagine marching to assembly with that on your arms. Every Monday, I was the odd one out, having a piece of ceiling on my head while everyone else marched normally.\n\nFast forward to **Class Four**. My teacher, was a part-time palm wine tapper, so, he asked us to help him carry palm wine. A sip turned into *drunk kids*. When i came home while tired and drunk, unfortunately for me, it was the day my grand ma usually goes to church so she told me to go sell beignets. Needless to say, none got sold. And yes, I got a beating that’s still etched in my memory (mince).\n\nBy **Class Six**, we moved to Tombel town. For common entrance, we had to do sports. After doing sports, my grand father was to come pick us up and two hours after sitting and waiting for him, we had to walk 15km from Ediseh to Coco camp because my grandfather had an issue to fix on the bike. That walk left me with painful blisters towards the balls.\n\nIn 2014, I started secondary school at **GBHS Tombel**, earning the nickname **“Bone Bif”** (because I was skinny). By Form Four, the Anglophone crisis escalated, and on **May 20, 2018**, we fled to the Littoral with a single box — my official “everything” box. Shortly after, I moved to Yaoundé, repeated Form Four in **GBPHS Yaounde**, and started making friends who’d change my life forever.\n\nThose friends introduced me to programming. By 2021, I went all-in on JavaScript. School grades? Let’s just say they weren’t great so, I finished the academic year with &lt;3.5 average which got me dismissed from **GBPHS Yaounde**.\n\n**After, I enrolled at GBHS Yaoundé (Essos).** Due to **COVID** back then the educational system in Cameroon was divided into shifts and mine was the afternoon shift, so my mornings were free perfect for coding. I focused on practical skills while repeating the year, building a solid foundation. A mentor told me:\n\n> *“Zenith, you excel in practical things but fail in theory. Give theory a chance next year.”*\n\nafter being in the same class for 2years, i did. The next year, I achieved **honor roll**, blending theory and practice, and went on to finish Upper Sixth. Upon completing my high school with the aid of some interesting friends i made in Essos that were always there to remind me to study, I stopped formal schooling and dove professionally into coding.\n\nlooking at it, in total, I had **three extra years** in my educational journey. Do I regret them? Not at all. Without them, I’m not sure I’d be here writing this, coding, and making the web a little less carbon-heavy.\n\nMy path wasn’t straight. There were doubts, detours, and moments I thought I’d made the wrong choices. But the output today speaks for itself, and I’m genuinely happy with where am at.\n\nLife rarely goes as planned.

    "content": "i've had crazy moments in my life however the most crazy one till date all come from when i was till in still.\n\nmy educational path wasn't as suit and straight as some of you reading this however i'll tell it's been the most interesting and till date when i tell people, they think i'm bluffing lol.\n\nfor new timers, i didn't attend nursery school(i like to believe that because i was so intelligent back then) i went directly to class one (first class in primary) i did this while school at government bilingual primary school ebubu in the south west region of cameroon tbp, tombel subdivision. while in class one, as a normal child, i was living with my grand parents (the most interesting and romantic you've seen) my grand mum will always yell at me because everyday when i'll come back home, something will be missing on me(i mean till date she still sings me that song in my ears how stubborn i was while in school). one thing i misplaced the most was arm boards, so my grandma did one crazy thing, she bought a ceiling board and divided it into four and gave a quater like wtf? while every monday we had assembly, when other pupil in my class were matching to enter their class, while swinging they hands, i couldn't because my hands were occupied with that ceiling board she gave me. fast forward i finished and went to class two, three and four. while still living in ebubu. in class four, our teacher was a part-time palm wine taper so one day wednesday, his bike was done and needed the boys to go help him bring the palm wine home so, we went with him. upon reaching there, he gave us a sip and God knows how sweet that wine was, it left from a sip to drinking we drank and got drunk. came back and my grand ma didn't know and back then she was selling beignet so i was told to sell while she left for church. upon coming back she met me sleeping and none of the beignet's were was sold and was giving one hell of a beating that day (i still remember it like yesterday)\n\nthen in class five, we left from that cdc camp in ebubu and went to town in tombel to live there full time however my grand father never wanted to put me in the public/private schools there because he was a teacher as well (he still is and he's been doing that for more than 50yrs now). so he said he has a bike and he was teaching there as well so i'll continue schooling there till i graduated from primary school. class five came and past, then class six came (last class in primary school). when it was the time to do sports for common entrance, we had to go in another village called \"Ediseh\" after the sports, it was around 12 noon towards 1pm i guess, before then, my grand father had to be there with his bike to take me and my friend 2hrs after waiting, he wasn't coming so we started walking. we walked and walked for more than 15km and then i saw my grand father pulling down the hill coming and that shit felt good. when i arived home, the flesh between my \"balls\" was pilled due to heat and the long distance and it was real painful\\\n\\\nin 2014, i started secondary school in government biling high school tombel form one and was one of the baddest students in school, i even got a name for myself back then \"Bone bif\" (oh boy i was skinny some will say bonny) then fast forward form two and three and four.\\\nin form four, things got really heated with the anglophone crises and we were going to school with dresses that we take to the farm and upon reaching the school you'll remove your uniform from a bag and dress on to enter the school. things got really serious when on the 19 of may 2018 when one of my aunties friend came and told us to leave the region because the seperationist where looking for francophone families during the national unity day may 20. so we left on May 20 at 6:41am for the littoral with one box (my box. ps: i still have it till date as my official box).\\\n\\\nwhen we arrived the littoral (our region of origin), we went to the family house and was there for like 2 weeks, and from there, my mum requested i come meet her in yaounde (the center and capital of the country) so i moved to yaounde. where i repeated form four because i didn't have a report card to prove.\\\ni started schooling at government bilingual practicing high school yaounde and i made some life changing friends that i still have till date. while being in gbphs, these friends on mine made me fall in love with programming, i didn't knew i'll be taking that shit seriously 5year after. fast forward in 2021, after having my ordinary levels, i decided to go all in to learn the ins and out of Javascript. i was going to school and never in class and because of this decision, you can already guess that my academic scores aren't to be good, and i won't tell you i did magic to fix them. they were bad as fuck i finished that academic year with &lt;3.5 average so for that, i got dismissed. when i came back that day, with my results and i showed it to my mum, she was sad and left home. i saw her a week after. from there i went to government bilingual high school yaounde (in essos).\n\nin essos, due to the covid, the midday system was still there. that means the little once will come in the morning while the elders big boys and girls like us will come from 12 while the other be going back home.\\\nthat academic year, i was in school like not in school, i already had the skills(mastery of the basics) so i was leveraging on that to build a professional foundation for myself so I repeated that academic year (2022-2023). during the summer, my mentor said something that stayed with me till date \"Zenith i don't no what's wrong with you. you keep on excelling at these practical related things however when it concerns theory, you're nil i want you to give theory a chance the upcoming academic year\" the upcoming academic year, i excelled with an honor role with the help of some incredible friends because i gave all in on both. and i went to uppersixth, then finished and stopped schooling and went professionally on coding.\\\n\\\nin total, i've had 3 extra years on my academic parcour. to be honnest i don't regret any because if i would've finished earlier, i'm not fucking sure i'd be writing this at this moment. talking more of me coding and making the web less carbon free. i really love what i'm doing today, ngl i won't tell you that my path as well in tech has been straight, there were i thought i made the wrong decision as well, however the output speaks for it self.\n\nand i'm really happy where i'm at rn.\\\nit's been a hell of a ride in my educational carrier some details were taken out but the most essentials were kept which you've read already.",
