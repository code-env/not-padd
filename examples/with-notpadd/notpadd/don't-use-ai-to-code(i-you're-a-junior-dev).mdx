If you’ve been around my site for a while, you’ve probably seen *Notpadd* — the CMS that generates content at build time in your Next.js app.

A few weeks ago, I was fixing a TypeScript error. I spent half an hour trying different things, nothing worked. So I did what most of us do now: copied the error and threw it into Cursor.

Boom one shot. It fixed it.\
I hit *“Keep all changes.”* Man, I was happy and satisfied.

Then I went for a walk.\
Halfway through, it hit me: *What did I just accept?*\
I realized I had no clue why the code worked.

That was my wake-up call.\
AI didn’t make me a smarter developer — it made me stop thinking.

If you’re a junior developer and your first move is to copy-paste an error into AI, you’re training yourself out of the one skill you need most: **problem-solving**.

Devs aren’t paid because they type fast (though that helps).\
They’re paid because they *think clearly* and can navigate complexity.

When I was in high school back in Cameroon, we had this math teacher — Madame Mbounjie. Every time she gave an assignment, I sometimes skipped it. Others would copy their classmates’ work and submit.

She could always tell who actually understood the material. She’d call you to the board and ask you to solve the same problem you claimed to have done at home. If you froze, she’d insult the devil out of you.

That’s what AI does today.\
It gives you the perfect answer — until it asks you to explain it.

AI-generated code often runs flawlessly. It even *feels* clean. You start thinking you’ve leveled up.\
Except… you didn’t code anything.\
You prompted. And you received.

Then comes the real test — adding a new feature.\
That’s when everything breaks, and you realize you never learned how it worked in the first place.

**Debugging** is where real growth happens.\
It’s your gym.\
And like most gyms, people quit before they get strong.

When you debug, you’re not just fixing issues — you’re training your brain to predict them. That’s how senior engineers think: they *see* problems before they appear, because they’ve suffered through them before.

So don’t just hit “Keep all changes.”\
Break it. Fix it. Learn why that method works better than yours.\
That’s where the mastery builds up — line by line.

Back in Cameroon, we deal with bad internet.\
When I first got access to Cursor Pro around March 2025, I felt unstoppable.\
I was shipping features in minutes, moving fast, fixing things on the fly.

Then one day I was traveling. My modem wasn’t connecting. Cursor needs internet to run completions.

Suddenly, I was staring at my editor — and my brain went blank.\
No autocomplete. No suggestions. Just me and an empty file.\
I couldn’t even type properly.

That’s when I realized: AI had given me the *illusion* of speed.\
I thought I was improving, but I was just automating my thinking away.

Without internet, I wasn’t a developer anymore. I was a spectator.

Now when I code — especially when tutoring interns — I sometimes turn off tab completion.\
Not because AI is bad, but because *struggle builds understanding*.

If you use AI, great. Just don’t skip the hard part.\
Try first. Fail first. Then ask *why* it didn’t work.

There’s a saying:

> “A problem well understood is 50% solved.”

That’s not just philosophy — it’s engineering truth.\
Most devs today build features they don’t fully understand.\
That’s why so many projects collapse before finding product–market fit: the builders never truly understood the problem.

They understood what *AI told them* the solution looked like.\
But they never lived with the pain long enough to see its shape.\
They never sat with the bug, wrestled with the edge case, traced the stack line by line until it clicked.

When you skip that, you skip growth.\
You skip the moment that turns you from a copier into a builder.

Before you ask AI, ask yourself:\
*What am I really trying to understand?*

AI can make you faster.\
But only clarity can make you good.
