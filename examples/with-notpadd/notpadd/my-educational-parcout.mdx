some people had “straight educational paths” in life. I didn’t. And honestly? That made my journey a lot more interesting (imo).

I skipped nursery school entirely, went straight to **Class One** at the government bilingual primary school in Ebubu, South West Cameroon. Maybe I was “too smart, (something i tell myself)” maybe just stubborn either way, I started school with a bang.

Living with my grandparents made everything more… dramatic. Every day I’d misplace something, from my uniform to shows and usually my arm boards and my grandma, in true legendary fashion, bought a ceiling board, cut it into four, and gave me a quarter to carry. Imagine marching to assembly with that on your arms. Every Monday, I was the odd one out, having a piece of ceiling on my head while everyone else marched normally.

Fast forward to **Class Four**. My teacher, was a part-time palm wine tapper, so, he asked us to help him carry palm wine. A sip turned into *drunk kids*. When i came home while tired and drunk, unfortunately for me, it was the day my grand ma usually goes to church so she told me to go sell beignets. Needless to say, none got sold. And yes, I got a beating that’s still etched in my memory (mince).

By **Class Six**, we moved to Tombel town. For common entrance, we had to do sports. After doing sports, my grand father was to come pick us up and two hours after sitting and waiting for him, we had to walk 15km from Ediseh to Coco camp because my grandfather had an issue to fix on the bike. That walk left me with painful blisters towards the balls.

In 2014, I started secondary school at **GBHS Tombel**, earning the nickname **“Bone Bif”** (because I was skinny). By Form Four, the Anglophone crisis escalated, and on **May 20, 2018**, we fled to the Littoral with a single box — my official “everything” box. Shortly after, I moved to Yaoundé, repeated Form Four in **GBPHS Yaounde**, and started making friends who’d change my life forever.

Those friends introduced me to programming. By 2021, I went all-in on JavaScript. School grades? Let’s just say they weren’t great so, I finished the academic year with &lt;3.5 average which got me dismissed from **GBPHS Yaounde**.

**After, I enrolled at GBHS Yaoundé (Essos).** Due to **COVID** back then the educational system in Cameroon was divided into shifts and mine was the afternoon shift, so my mornings were free perfect for coding. I focused on practical skills while repeating the year, building a solid foundation. A mentor told me:

> *“Zenith, you excel in practical things but fail in theory. Give theory a chance next year.”*

after being in the same class for 2years, i did. The next year, I achieved **honor roll**, blending theory and practice, and went on to finish Upper Sixth. Upon completing my high school with the aid of some interesting friends i made in Essos that were always there to remind me to study, I stopped formal schooling and dove professionally into coding.

looking at it, in total, I had **three extra years** in my educational journey. Do I regret them? Not at all. Without them, I’m not sure I’d be here writing this, coding, and making the web a little less carbon-heavy.

My path wasn’t straight. There were doubts, detours, and moments I thought I’d made the wrong choices. But the output today speaks for itself, and I’m genuinely happy with where am at.

Life rarely goes as planned. But sometimes, the chaotic, “non-linear” routes are exactly what prepare you for the work you love. And that, above all, makes it worth it.

thanks to Bogne Merveille for the inspiration on writing this.
