Notpadd is a content workspace built for developers who use Next.js. It was created from a frustration I’ve had for a long time: having to open a code editor just to publish or update a simple blog post. Most CMS platforms today are either too complex or too slow. They rely on API calls every time someone visits your site, which means waiting for data to load, caching issues, and the constant risk of something breaking between deployments.

Notpadd takes a different approach. Instead of fetching content from an external source every time, it generates and syncs your content directly at build time. That means your site remains fast, consistent, and reliable without the extra complexity of managing APIs or caching layers.

It integrates seamlessly with your Next.js project, allowing you to manage content right from the browser. When you write or edit an article in Notpadd, your changes are reflected automatically, and your site stays in sync with your GitHub repository. It’s designed to eliminate friction and make publishing as effortless as writing a thought.

At its core, Notpadd isn’t trying to replace existing CMS tools. It’s built for developers who prefer simplicity, speed, and control — those who want their content to live as code, but without the overhead of constantly touching their editor or managing markdown files manually.

Notpadd is for anyone who believes that writing and publishing should be as natural as pushing code.
