It's a good thing to be bored.

```jsx
import * as React from "react";
import { Slot } from "@radix-ui/react-slot";
import { cva, type VariantProps } from "class-variance-authority";

import { cn } from "@notpadd/ui/lib/utils";

const buttonVariants = cva(
  "inline-flex items-center justify-center gap-2 cursor-pointer whitespace-nowrap rounded-md text-sm font-medium transition-[color,box-shadow] disabled:pointer-events-none disabled:opacity-50 [&_svg]:pointer-events-none [&_svg:not([class*='size-'])]:size-4 shrink-0 [&_svg]:shrink-0 outline-none aria-invalid:ring-destructive/20 dark:aria-invalid:ring-destructive/40 aria-invalid:border-destructive select-none active:scale-[0.98]",
  {
    variants: {
      variant: {
        default: "border bg-white text-gray-900 shadow-xs hover:bg-gray-50",
        destructive:
          "bg-destructive text-white shadow-xs hover:bg-destructive/90 focus-visible:ring-destructive/20 dark:focus-visible:ring-destructive/40",
        outline:
          "border border-input bg-background shadow-xs hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground",
        secondary:
          "bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground shadow-xs hover:bg-secondary/80",
        ghost: "hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground",
        link: "text-primary underline-offset-4 hover:underline",
      },
      size: {
        default: " px-4 py-2.5 has-[>svg]:px-3",
        sm: "py-2 rounded-md gap-1.5 px-3 has-[>svg]:px-2.5",
        lg: "py-3 rounded-md px-6 has-[>svg]:px-4",
        icon: "size-9",
      },
    },
    defaultVariants: {
      variant: "default",
      size: "default",
    },

type ButtonProps = React.ComponentProps<"button"> &
  VariantProps<typeof buttonVariants> & {
    asChild?: boolean;

function Button({
  className,
  variant,
  size,
  asChild = false,
  ...props
}: ButtonProps) {
  const Comp = asChild ? Slot : "button";
  return (
    <Comp
      data-slot="button"
      className={cn(buttonVariants({ variant, size, className }))}

export { Button, buttonVariants };

We live in a world that's constantly trying to entertain us. \
Infinite scroll. \
Push notifications. \
24/7 content. \
We’re more connected, more stimulated, and more distracted than ever before and yet, the second silence enters the room, people panic and others are surprised.

But let’s say this loud and clear:

**It’s a good thing to be bored.**

You know what happens when your brain isn't being bombarded with dopamine?

It *thinks*. \
It *wanders*. \
It *creates*. \
It *connects* dots that you didn't know were there.

Boredom is the empty page before the story starts. \
It’s the silence before the music. \
It’s your mind saying, “Hey, no one’s talking at me what if I explored something on my own for once?”

Some of the best ideas, inventions, and breakthroughs in the world came from people who were *just bored enough* to sit still and think.

Hand a kid a stick and some time and they’ll invent a whole universe. \
Why? Because boredom forces imagination. \
It invites curiosity. It builds problem-solving muscles.

Now hand an adult a moment of stillness and they reach for their phone. \
They don’t even know what they’re avoiding. But they’re *definitely* avoiding something.

Let’s get real for a second: even in love, boredom creeps in. \
The early days are exciting dopamine highs, endless texts, late-night calls.

Then routine kicks in. You’ve seen each other’s weird habits. You know what they’ll say before they say it.

And guess what? That’s normal.

But here’s the magic: **healthy relationships survive boredom**. \
The real question isn’t “How do we stay excited 24/7?” \
It’s: *“Can we sit in silence and still feel connected?”*

Can we be boring together, and still choose each other? \
Can we find meaning in the mundane?

Because love isn’t built on constant thrills it’s built on deep, stable rhythms. Boredom in a relationship isn’t a sign of failure. It’s a sign of *familiarity*. What matters is what you do with that space. How you grow in it. How you create new layers of intimacy and adventure not by running, but by staying.

Next time you find yourself reaching for your phone out of habit, stop.

Sit with the silence. Let your mind stretch. Be bored *on purpose*.

That boredom is a blank canvas. What you do with it? That’s the masterpiece.

### TL;DR:

Boredom isn’t the problem. It’s the opportunity. \
Don’t fear it. Don’t fill it. \
Let it teach you. Let it slow you down. \
Let it help you build yourself, your ideas, your relationships.

*Sometimes the best version of you is hiding behind the part of you that’s afraid to be bored.*
