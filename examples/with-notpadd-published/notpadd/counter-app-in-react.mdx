Building a Counter Component in React

React makes it easy to build reusable UI components. Let’s create a simple counter app that increments and decrements a number.

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div style={{ textAlign: "center", marginTop: "50px" }}>
      <h1>{count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>-</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>+</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### How It Works

- `useState(0)` initializes the counter at `0`.

- The `setCount` function updates the state.

- When you click `+` or `-`, the number changes instantly — thanks to React’s reactivity.

That’s it! You’ve built a functional counter in just a few lines.
