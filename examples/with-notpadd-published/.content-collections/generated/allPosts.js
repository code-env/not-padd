Because boredom forces imagination. \\\nIt invites curiosity. It builds problem-solving muscles.\n\nNow hand an adult a moment of stillness and they reach for their phone. \\\nThey don’t even know what they’re avoiding. But they’re *definitely* avoiding something.\n\nLet’s get real for a second: even in love, boredom creeps in. \\\nThe early days are exciting dopamine highs, endless texts, late-night calls.\n\nThen routine kicks in. You’ve seen each other’s weird habits. You know what they’ll say before they say it.\n\nAnd guess what? That’s normal.\n\nBut here’s the magic: **healthy relationships survive boredom**. \\\nThe real question isn’t “How do we stay excited 24/7?” \\\nIt’s: *“Can we sit in silence and still feel connected?”*\n\nCan we be boring together, and still choose each other? \\\nCan we find meaning in the mundane?\n\nBecause love isn’t built on constant thrills it’s built on deep, stable rhythms. Boredom in a relationship isn’t a sign of failure. It’s a sign of *familiarity*. What matters is what you do with that space. How you grow in it. How you create new layers of intimacy and adventure not by running, but by staying.\n\nNext time you find yourself reaching for your phone out of habit, stop.\n\nSit with the silence. Let your mind stretch. Be bored *on purpose*.\n\nThat boredom is a blank canvas. What you do with it? That’s the masterpiece.\n\n### TL;DR:\n\nBoredom isn’t the problem. It’s the opportunity. \\\nDon’t fear it. Don’t fill it. \\\nLet it teach you. Let it slow you down. \\\nLet it help you build yourself, your ideas, your relationships.\n\n*Sometimes the best version of you is hiding behind the part of you that’s afraid to be bored.*\n\nStarted writing on: Jun 2, 2025\n\nFinished writing on: Jun 27, 2025",

    "content": "some people had “straight educational paths” in life. I didn’t. And honestly? That made my journey a lot more interesting (imo).\n\nI skipped nursery school entirely, went straight to **Class One** at the government bilingual primary school in Ebubu, South West Cameroon. Maybe I was “too smart, (something i tell myself)” maybe just stubborn either way, I started school with a bang.\n\nLiving with my grandparents made everything more… dramatic. Every day I’d misplace something, from my uniform to shows and usually my arm boards and my grandma, in true legendary fashion, bought a ceiling board, cut it into four, and gave me a quarter to carry. Imagine marching to assembly with that on your arms. Every Monday, I was the odd one out, having a piece of ceiling on my head while everyone else marched normally.\n\nFast forward to **Class Four**. My teacher, was a part-time palm wine tapper, so, he asked us to help him carry palm wine. A sip turned into *drunk kids*. When i came home while tired and drunk, unfortunately for me, it was the day my grand ma usually goes to church so she told me to go sell beignets. Needless to say, none got sold. And yes, I got a beating that’s still etched in my memory (mince).\n\nBy **Class Six**, we moved to Tombel town. For common entrance, we had to do sports. After doing sports, my grand father was to come pick us up and two hours after sitting and waiting for him, we had to walk 15km from Ediseh to Coco camp because my grandfather had an issue to fix on the bike. That walk left me with painful blisters towards the balls.\n\nIn 2014, I started secondary school at **GBHS Tombel**, earning the nickname **“Bone Bif”** (because I was skinny). By Form Four, the Anglophone crisis escalated, and on **May 20, 2018**, we fled to the Littoral with a single box — my official “everything” box. Shortly after, I moved to Yaoundé, repeated Form Four in **GBPHS Yaounde**, and started making friends who’d change my life forever.\n\nThose friends introduced me to programming. By 2021, I went all-in on JavaScript. School grades? Let’s just say they weren’t great so, I finished the academic year with &lt;3.5 average which got me dismissed from **GBPHS Yaounde**.\n\n**After, I enrolled at GBHS Yaoundé (Essos).** Due to **COVID** back then the educational system in Cameroon was divided into shifts and mine was the afternoon shift, so my mornings were free perfect for coding. I focused on practical skills while repeating the year, building a solid foundation. A mentor told me:\n\n> *“Zenith, you excel in practical things but fail in theory. Give theory a chance next year.”*\n\nafter being in the same class for 2years, i did. The next year, I achieved **honor roll**, blending theory and practice, and went on to finish Upper Sixth. Upon completing my high school with the aid of some interesting friends i made in Essos that were always there to remind me to study, I stopped formal schooling and dove professionally into coding.\n\nlooking at it, in total, I had **three extra years** in my educational journey. Do I regret them? Not at all. Without them, I’m not sure I’d be here writing this, coding, and making the web a little less carbon-heavy.\n\nMy path wasn’t straight. There were doubts, detours, and moments I thought I’d made the wrong choices. But the output today speaks for itself, and I’m genuinely happy with where am at.\n\nLife rarely goes as planned. But sometimes, the chaotic, “non-linear” routes are exactly what prepare you for the work you love. And that, above all, makes it worth it.\n\nthanks to Bogne Merveille for the inspiration on writing this.",

    "content": "## Introduction\n\nNvii is a secure environment variable management platform designed for modern development teams. It provides end to end encryption, version control, and seamless collaboration for managing environment variables across your projects. With Nvii, you can track changes, rollback to previous versions, manage branches, and ensure your sensitive configuration data remains secure.\n\n## Features\n\nNvii offers a comprehensive set of features including:\n\n**Security**: End to end encryption for all environment variables, secure authentication, device based session management\n\n**Version Control**: Complete history tracking, version rollback capabilities, branch management for different environments\n\n**Collaboration**: Team based access control, conflict resolution, synchronized updates across devices\n\n**Developer Experience**: Intuitive CLI commands, dry run capabilities, automated conflict detection\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall Nvii globally using npm\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g nvii\n```\n\non linux:\n\n```bash\nsudo npm install -g nvii\n```\n\n## Getting Started\n\nBefore using Nvii, you need to authenticate and create or link a project. Here's a quick start workflow:\n\n1\\. Login to your Nvii account: `nvii login`\n\n2\\. Create a new project: `nvii new`\n\n3\\. Push your environment variables: `nvii push`\n\n4\\. Pull changes on other machines: `nvii pull`\n\n## Authentication Commands\n\n### Login\n\nAuthenticate and establish a secure session with Nvii. This command opens a browser window for authentication and stores your credentials locally.\n\n```bash\nnvii login\n```\n\nThe login process generates a unique confirmation code and establishes a secure connection. Your credentials are stored in your home directory for subsequent CLI operations.\n\n### Logout\n\nTerminate your current session and clear authentication credentials from your local machine.\n\n```bash\nnvii logout\n```\n\n**Options:**\n\n`-u, --username <username>`: Specify the username of the account to logout from\n\n`-e, --email <email>`: Specify the email of the account to logout from\n\n**Examples:**\n\n```bash\n# Interactive logout with confirmation\nnvii logout\n\n# Logout specific user by username\n\nnvii logout --username johndoe\n\n# Logout specific user by email\n\nnvii logout --email [john@example.com](mailto:john@example.com)\n```\n\n### Whoami\n\nDisplay information about the currently authenticated user, including username and email address.\n\n```bash\nnvii whoami\n```\n\nThis command helps verify your authentication status and confirms which account you're currently using.\n\n## Project Management Commands\n\n### New\n\nInitialize a new project and configure environment variable management. This command reads your local .env file, encrypts the contents, and creates a new project in the Nvii platform.\n\n```bash\nnvii new\n```\n\nThe command will prompt you for:\n\n**Project name**: A descriptive name for your project\n\n**Project description**: Optional description explaining the project's purpose\n\nAfter creation, your project is automatically linked to the current directory.\n\n### Link\n\nConnect the current directory to an existing remote project. This is useful when working on multiple machines or onboarding new team members.\n\n```bash\nnvii link\n```\n\n**Options:**\n\n`-t, --token <id>`: Specify a project ID to connect to directly\n\n**Examples:**\n\n```bash\n# Interactive project selection\n\nnvii link\n\n# Link to specific project by ID\n\nnvii link --token abc123xyz\n```\n\nThe link command creates a `.nvii` directory in your current folder containing the project configuration.\n\n### Unlink\n\nDisconnect the current directory from its linked remote project. This removes the local `.nvii` configuration directory.\n\n```bash\nnvii unlink\n```\n\nYou'll be asked to confirm before the unlinking process completes. This operation only affects your local machine and doesn't delete the remote project.\n\n## Environment Variable Operations\n\n### Pull\n\nFetch and merge environment variables from the remote repository. This command retrieves the latest version from the server and updates your local .env file.\n\n```bash\nnvii pull\n```\n\n**Options:**\n\n`-f, --force`: Force pull without conflict resolution prompts, automatically accepting remote values &lt;br /&gt;\n\n`-b, --branch <branch>`: Pull from a specific branch (default: main) &lt;br /&gt;\n\n`-dry, --dry-run`: Preview changes without applying them to your local file &lt;br /&gt;\n\n**Examples:**\n\n```bash\n# Standard pull with conflict resolution\nnvii pull\n\n# Force pull, accepting all remote changes\n\nnvii pull --force\n\n# Pull from development branch\n\nnvii pull --branch development\n\n# Preview changes without applying\n\nnvii pull --dry-run\n```\n\n**Conflict Resolution:**\n\nWhen conflicts are detected, Nvii will prompt you to choose between keeping your local value or accepting the remote value for each conflicting variable.\n\n### Push\n\nUpload local environment variable changes and create a new version. This command encrypts your local .env file and pushes it to the remote repository.\n\n\\`\\`\\`bash\n\nnvii push\n\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n**Options:**\n\n`-m, --message <message>`: Provide a version description message &lt;br /&gt;\n\n`-b, --branch <branch>`: Push to a specific branch (default: main) &lt;br /&gt;\n\n`-dry, --dry-run`: Preview changes without uploading &lt;br /&gt;\n\n**Examples:**\n\n```bash\n# Push with inline message\nnvii push --message \"Added database credentials\"\n\n# Interactive push with prompt for message\n\nnvii push\n\n# Push to staging branch\n\nnvii push --branch staging --message \"Update API keys\"\n\n# Preview changes before pushing\n\nnvii push --dry-run\n```\n\nThe push command displays a summary of added, modified, and removed variables before creating the new version.\n\n### Update\n\nSynchronize local environment file with the latest remote version. This command updates your .env file to match the most recent version without interactive conflict resolution.\n\n```bash\nnvii update\n```\n\nThis is useful for quickly syncing when you know the remote version should take precedence.\n\n## Version Control Commands\n\n### Log\n\nDisplay version history and change log for the current project. This command shows all versions with their descriptions, authors, and timestamps.\n\n```bash\nnvii log\n```\n\n**Options:**\n\n`-n, --limit <number>`: Limit the number of versions to display (default: 10) &lt;br /&gt;\n\n`--oneline`: Show condensed one line format for each version &lt;br /&gt;\n\n`--author <email>`: Filter versions by author email or name &lt;br /&gt;\n\n**Examples:**\n\n```bash\n# Show last 10 versions\nnvii log\n\n# Show last 5 versions\n\nnvii log --limit 5\n\n# Compact one-line format\n\nnvii log --oneline\n\n# Filter by author\n\nnvii log --author [john@example.com](mailto:john@example.com)\n\n# Combine options\n\nnvii log --limit 20 --oneline --author jane\n```\n\n**Output Formats:**\n\nDefault format shows detailed information including version ID, author, timestamp, and description message.\n\nOneline format provides a compact view: `<version-id> <date> <author> <message>`\n\n### Rollback\n\nRestore environment variables to a previous version state. This command updates your local .env file to match the content from a selected historical version.\n\n```bash\nnvii rollback\n```\n\n**Options:**\n\n`-v, --version <id>`: Specify a version ID to rollback to directly &lt;br /&gt;\n\n`-f, --force`: Skip confirmation prompts &lt;br /&gt;\n\n**Examples:**\n\n```bash\n# Interactive version selection\nnvii rollback\n\n# Rollback to specific version\n\nnvii rollback --version abc123def456\n\n# Rollback without confirmation\n\nnvii rollback --version abc123def456 --force\n```\n\nThe rollback command displays available versions and asks for confirmation before updating your local file. This operation doesn't delete any versions, it simply updates your working copy.\n\n### Merge\n\nConsolidate multiple environment variable versions into the main branch. This command helps merge changes from feature branches back into your main branch.\n\n```bash\nnvii merge\n```\n\n**Options:**\n\n`-s, --source <branch>`: Source branch to merge from &lt;br /&gt;\n\n`-t, --target <branch>`: Target branch to merge into (default: main) &lt;br /&gt;\n\n**Examples:**\n\n```bash\n# Merge with prompts \nnvii merge\n\n# Merge development into main\n\nnvii merge --source development --target main\n```\n\n## Branch Management Commands\n\n### Branch\n\nCreate a new branch from the current or specified version. Branches allow you to maintain separate environment configurations for different environments like development, staging, and production.\n\n```bash\nnvii branch\n```\n\n**Options:**\n\n`-n, --name <name>`: Specify the branch name &lt;br /&gt;\n\n`-v, --version <id>`: Base version ID to branch from (default: latest version) &lt;br /&gt;\n\n**Examples:**\n\n```bash\n# Create branch interactively\nnvii branch\n\n# Create named branch from latest version\n\nnvii branch --name development\n\n# Create branch from specific version\n\nnvii branch --name hotfix --version abc123def\n```\n\nBranch names can contain letters, numbers, dots, underscores, hyphens, and slashes.\n\n### Branches\n\nList all branches for the current project. This command displays all available branches with their base versions and creation dates.\n\n```bash\nnvii branches\n```\n\nThe output shows:\n\nActive branches marked with an asterisk &lt;br /&gt;\n\nCurrent branch you're working on &lt;br /&gt;\n\nBase version ID for each branch &lt;br /&gt;\n\nCreation timestamp &lt;br /&gt;\n\n### Checkout\n\nSwitch to a different branch. This command updates your local configuration to work with a specified branch.\n\n```bash\nnvii checkout\n```\n\n**Options:**\n\n`-n, --name <name>`: Branch name to switch to\n\n**Examples:**\n\n```bash\n# Interactive branch selection\nnvii checkout\n\n# Switch to specific branch\n\nnvii checkout --name development\n```\n\nAfter switching branches, your subsequent push and pull operations will target the selected branch.\n\n## Version Tagging Commands\n\n### Tag\n\nCreate a new tag for the current or specified version. Tags provide named references to specific versions, useful for marking releases or significant milestones.\n\n```bash\nnvii tag\n```\n\n**Options:**\n\n`-n, --name <name>`: Tag name to use &lt;br /&gt;\n\n`-v, --version <id>`: Version ID to tag (default: latest version) &lt;br /&gt;\n\n**Examples:**\n\n```bash\n# Create tag interactively\nnvii tag\n\n# Create named tag for latest version\n\nnvii tag --name v1.0.0\n\n# Create tag for specific version\n\nnvii tag --name production-release --version abc123def\n```\n\nTag names can contain letters, numbers, dots, underscores, and hyphens. They're commonly used for semantic versioning (e.g., v1.0.0, v2.1.3).\n\n### Tags\n\nList all tags for the current project. This command displays all tags with their associated version IDs, descriptions, and creation dates.\n\n```bash\nnvii tags\n```\n\nThe output includes tag names, linked version IDs, optional descriptions, and timestamps.\n\n## Utility Commands\n\n### Generate\n\nCreate a template .env file from your current environment variables. This command generates an example file with variable names but empty values, perfect for sharing with team members or documenting required variables.\n\n```bash\nnvii generate\n```\n\n**Options:**\n\n`-o, --output <file>`: Specify output file path (default: .env.example) &lt;br /&gt;\n\n`--format <type>`: Choose output format: env, json, or yaml (default: env)\n\n**Examples:**\n\n```bash\n# Generate .env.example file\n\nnvii generate\n\n# Generate with custom output path\n\nnvii generate --output .env.template\n\n# Generate JSON format\n\nnvii generate --format json\n\n# Generate YAML format\n\nnvii generate --format yaml --output config.yaml\n```\n\n**Output Formats:**\n\n`env`: Standard .env file format with empty values\n\n`json`: JSON object with variable keys and empty string values\n\n`yaml`: YAML format with variable keys and empty values\n\n### Test\n\nVerify encryption and decryption functionality. This command tests the encryption system by encrypting your environment variables and then decrypting them, displaying both versions.\n\n```bash\nnvii test\n```\n\nThis is primarily used for debugging and verifying that the encryption system is working correctly with your credentials.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n**Version Messages**: Always provide descriptive messages when pushing changes, similar to git commit messages\n\n**Branch Strategy**: Use branches for different environments (development, staging, production)\n\n**Regular Syncing**: Pull changes before starting work and push when done to keep your team synchronized\n\n**Dry Run First**: Use the dry run flag to preview changes before applying them, especially with pull operations\n\n**Tag Releases**: Create tags for production releases to easily rollback if needed\n\n**Conflict Resolution**: When conflicts occur, carefully review each variable to choose the correct value\n\n## Common Workflows\n\n### Setting Up a New Project\n\n```bash\n# Login to Nvii\nnvii login\n\n# Create a new project\n\nnvii new\n\n# Push your initial environment variables\n\nnvii push --message \"Initial environment setup\"\n```\n\n### Joining an Existing Project\n\n```bash\n# Login to Nvii\n\nnvii login\n\n# Link to the project\n\nnvii link\n\n# Pull the environment variables\n\nnvii pull\n```\n\n### Daily Development Workflow\n\n```bash\n# Start of day: pull latest changes\n\nnvii pull\n\n# Make changes to your .env file\n\n# ...\n\n# End of day: push your changes\n\nnvii push --message \"Updated database connection strings\"\n```\n\n### Managing Multiple Environments\n\n```bash\n# Create branches for different environments\n\nnvii branch --name development\n\nnvii branch --name staging\n\nnvii branch --name production\n\n# Switch to development\n\nnvii checkout --name development\n\n# Push changes to development\n\nnvii push --message \"Dev environment config\"\n\n# Switch to production\n\nnvii checkout --name production\n\n# Pull production config\n\nnvii pull\n```\n\n### Rolling Back After a Mistake\n\n```bash\n# View recent changes\n\nnvii log --limit 10\n\n# Rollback to a previous version\n\nnvii rollback --version abc123def\n\n# Or use interactive selection\n\nnvii rollback\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Authentication Issues\n\nIf you're having trouble logging in, try logging out first and then logging in again:\n\n```bash\nnvii logout\n\nnvii login\n```\n\n### Project Not Linked\n\nIf you see \"Project not linked\" errors, ensure you've linked your project:\n\n```bash\nnvii link\n```\n\n### Conflicts During Pull\n\nIf you encounter conflicts, you can either resolve them interactively or force pull with the remote values:\n\n```bash\n# Interactive resolution\n\nnvii pull\n\n# Force accept remote values\n\nnvii pull --force\n```\n\n### Missing Environment File\n\nEnsure you have a .env or .env.local file in your current directory before running commands like push or generate.\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n**Encryption**: All environment variables are encrypted using end to end encryption before transmission &lt;br/&gt;\n\n**Device Authentication**: Each device requires separate authentication for security &lt;br/&gt;\n\n**Local Storage**: Credentials are stored securely in your home directory &lt;br/&gt;\n\n**Access Control**: Project access is managed through team permissions &lt;br/&gt;\n\n**Version History**: All changes are tracked and can be audited\n\n## Version\n\nCurrent CLI version: 1.0.3\n\nCheck your installed version:\n\n```bash\nnvii --version\n```",

    "content": "i've had crazy moments in my life however the most crazy one till date all come from when i was till in still.\n\nmy educational path wasn't as suit and straight as some of you reading this however i'll tell it's been the most interesting and till date when i tell people, they think i'm bluffing lol.\n\nfor new timers, i didn't attend nursery school(i like to believe that because i was so intelligent back then) i went directly to class one (first class in primary) i did this while school at government bilingual primary school ebubu in the south west region of cameroon tbp, tombel subdivision. while in class one, as a normal child, i was living with my grand parents (the most interesting and romantic you've seen) my grand mum will always yell at me because everyday when i'll come back home, something will be missing on me(i mean till date she still sings me that song in my ears how stubborn i was while in school). one thing i misplaced the most was arm boards, so my grandma did one crazy thing, she bought a ceiling board and divided it into four and gave a quater like wtf? while every monday we had assembly, when other pupil in my class were matching to enter their class, while swinging they hands, i couldn't because my hands were occupied with that ceiling board she gave me. fast forward i finished and went to class two, three and four. while still living in ebubu. in class four, our teacher was a part-time palm wine taper so one day wednesday, his bike was done and needed the boys to go help him bring the palm wine home so, we went with him. upon reaching there, he gave us a sip and God knows how sweet that wine was, it left from a sip to drinking we drank and got drunk. came back and my grand ma didn't know and back then she was selling beignet so i was told to sell while she left for church. upon coming back she met me sleeping and none of the beignet's were was sold and was giving one hell of a beating that day (i still remember it like yesterday)\n\nthen in class five, we left from that cdc camp in ebubu and went to town in tombel to live there full time however my grand father never wanted to put me in the public/private schools there because he was a teacher as well (he still is and he's been doing that for more than 50yrs now). so he said he has a bike and he was teaching there as well so i'll continue schooling there till i graduated from primary school. class five came and past, then class six came (last class in primary school). when it was the time to do sports for common entrance, we had to go in another village called \"Ediseh\" after the sports, it was around 12 noon towards 1pm i guess, before then, my grand father had to be there with his bike to take me and my friend 2hrs after waiting, he wasn't coming so we started walking. we walked and walked for more than 15km and then i saw my grand father pulling down the hill coming and that shit felt good. when i arived home, the flesh between my \"balls\" was pilled due to heat and the long distance and it was real painful\\\n\\\nin 2014, i started secondary school in government biling high school tombel form one and was one of the baddest students in school, i even got a name for myself back then \"Bone bif\" (oh boy i was skinny some will say bonny) then fast forward form two and three and four.\\\nin form four, things got really heated with the anglophone crises and we were going to school with dresses that we take to the farm and upon reaching the school you'll remove your uniform from a bag and dress on to enter the school. things got really serious when on the 19 of may 2018 when one of my aunties friend came and told us to leave the region because the seperationist where looking for francophone families during the national unity day may 20. so we left on May 20 at 6:41am for the littoral with one box (my box. ps: i still have it till date as my official box).\\\n\\\nwhen we arrived the littoral (our region of origin), we went to the family house and was there for like 2 weeks, and from there, my mum requested i come meet her in yaounde (the center and capital of the country) so i moved to yaounde. where i repeated form four because i didn't have a report card to prove.\\\ni started schooling at government bilingual practicing high school yaounde and i made some life changing friends that i still have till date. while being in gbphs, these friends on mine made me fall in love with programming, i didn't knew i'll be taking that shit seriously 5year after. fast forward in 2021, after having my ordinary levels, i decided to go all in to learn the ins and out of Javascript. i was going to school and never in class and because of this decision, you can already guess that my academic scores aren't to be good, and i won't tell you i did magic to fix them. they were bad as fuck i finished that academic year with &lt;3.5 average so for that, i got dismissed. when i came back that day, with my results and i showed it to my mum, she was sad and left home. i saw her a week after. from there i went to government bilingual high school yaounde (in essos).\n\nin essos, due to the covid, the midday system was still there. that means the little once will come in the morning while the elders big boys and girls like us will come from 12 while the other be going back home.\\\nthat academic year, i was in school like not in school, i already had the skills(mastery of the basics) so i was leveraging on that to build a professional foundation for myself so I repeated that academic year (2022-2023). during the summer, my mentor said something that stayed with me till date \"Zenith i don't no what's wrong with you. you keep on excelling at these practical related things however when it concerns theory, you're nil i want you to give theory a chance the upcoming academic year\" the upcoming academic year, i excelled with an honor role with the help of some incredible friends because i gave all in on both. and i went to uppersixth, then finished and stopped schooling and went professionally on coding.\\\n\\\nin total, i've had 3 extra years on my academic parcour. to be honnest i don't regret any because if i would've finished earlier, i'm not fucking sure i'd be writing this at this moment. talking more of me coding and making the web less carbon free. i really love what i'm doing today, ngl i won't tell you that my path as well in tech has been straight, there were i thought i made the wrong decision as well, however the output speaks for it self.\n\nand i'm really happy where i'm at rn.\\\nit's been a hell of a ride in my educational carrier some details were taken out but the most essentials were kept which you've read already.",
